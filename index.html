            I am a 3rd year Computer Science
            <strong>graduate student</strong> concentrating in
            <em>Aritifical Intelligence and Machine Learning</em> in Cal Poly's
            Blended Master's Program. In recent years, I've gained extensive
            experience in <strong>full stack development</strong>,
            <strong>machine learning</strong>, and
            <strong>project management</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently seeking <em>internships/co-ops</em> for 2024-2025 in
            <strong>fast-paced, team-focused</strong> environments.
