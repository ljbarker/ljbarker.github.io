        I am a 3rd year Computer Science
        <strong>graduate student</strong> concentrating in
        <em>Aritifical Intelligence and Machine Learning</em> in Cal Poly's
        Blended Master's Program. In recent years, I've gained extensive
        experience in <strong>full stack development</strong>,
        <strong>machine learning</strong>, and
        <strong>project management</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently seeking <em>internships/co-ops</em> for 2024-2025 in
        <strong>fast-paced, team-focused</strong> environments.
